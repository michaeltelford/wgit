# Contributing

## Consult

Before you make a contribution, reach out on Github about what changes need made. Otherwise, your time spent might be wasted. Once you're clear on what needs done follow the technical steps below.

## Technical Steps

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch
- Write some tests (which fail)
- Write some code
- Re-run the tests (which now hopefully pass)
- Push your branch to your `origin` remote
- Open a GitHub Pull Request (with the target branch as wgit's (upstream) `master`)
- Apply any requested changes
- Wait for your PR to be merged

## Thanks

Thanks in advance for your contribution.
