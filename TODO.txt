Primary
-------
- Update Database#search & Document#search to have optional case sensitivity.
- Have the ability to crawl sub sections of a site only e.g. https://www.honda.co.uk/motorcycles.html as the base url and crawl any links containing this as a prefix. For example, https://www.honda.co.uk/cars.html would not be crawled but https://www.honda.co.uk/motorcycles/africa-twin.html would be.
- Create an executable based on the ./bin/console shipped as `wpry` or `wgit`.

Secondary
---------
- Think about how we handle invalid Url's on crawled documents. Setup tests and implement logic for this scenario.
- Check if Document::TEXT_ELEMENTS is expansive enough.

Refactoring
-----------
- Plan to open up the required_ruby_version range, say from 2.5 upwards e.g. `~> 2.5`. Will need CI testing for the different versions of ruby as we move onto support newer versions.
- Refactor the 3 main classes and their tests (where needed): Url, Document & Crawler.
- After the above refactor, move onto the rest of the code base.
- Think about reducing the amount of method aliases, pick the best for the method def and remove the aliases? Also, do the Url#to_* make sense?
- Replace method params with named parameters where applicable.
- Possibly use refine instead of core-ext?
- Think about potentially using DB._update's update_many func.

Gem Publishing Checklist
------------------------
- Ensure a clean branch of master and create a 'release' branch.
- Update standalone files (if necessary): README.md, TODO.txt, wgit.gemspec etc.
- Increment the version number (in version.rb) and update the CHANGELOG.md.
- Run 'bundle install' to update deps.
- Run 'bundle exec rake compile' and ensure acceptable warnings.
- Run 'bundle exec rake test' and ensure all tests are passing.
- Run `bundle exec rake install` to build and install the gem locally, then test it manually from outside this repo.
- Run `bundle exec yardoc` to update documentation - should be 100% coverage.
- Commit, merge to master & push any changes made from the above steps.
- Run `bundle exec rake RELEASE[origin]` to tag, build and push everything to github.com and rubygems.org.
